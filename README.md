# Undernourishment by country
The goal of this project is to create an algoirthm that considers poverty and other factors to predict heart disease mortality rate in counties across the United States. Please see the [FAO website](http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/211/en/) for more information.
Data for this project comes for the FAO and the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/)

## Table of Contents 
The following jupyter notebooks are provided:
1. Data Preparation
2. Data Visualization and Wrangling
3. Model preparation and algorithm testing

It is specially interesting to see how data is prepared for algorithm testing the thrid file, as it shows how I deal with colinearity and use repeated country rows to extract data patterns.
